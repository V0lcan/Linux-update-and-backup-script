# Work in progress

## Description
A script that updates my Linux laptop and backs up select folders to my NAS. Made to work with any Linux machine but I have not tried if it works on a windows machine yet.

The script will create a directory in the home directory with a temp folder, log file and config file. The config file needs to be edited by changing all lines with a CHANGEME placeholder to the proper information.
